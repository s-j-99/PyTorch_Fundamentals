# PyTorch_Fundamentals
Learning PyTorch from the repository made by MrDBourke, available at https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning.git.

Here, I document the progress I have made in following the PyTorch tutorials in my local Google Colab.

PyTorch00: Learning the basic operations and data structures of PyTorch.

PyTorch01: Developing a pipeline for a simple linear regression model, writing a training loop and evaluating model performance.
